    "## Description of the Problem\n",
    "Thanks to advancing technology, the use of machine learning in the healthcare industry is becoming increasingly popular to assist doctors in making diagnoses.Machine learning plays an important role in diagnosing diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart diseases.According to our research, many machine learning algorithms have been tried from past to present in the diagnosis of heart disease and artificial neural networks give the most accurate results. In this project, we will analyze the data in the best way and compare which algorithm gives the most accurate model by using the machine learning algorithms we have learned in this lecture. Since this is a binary classification problem, we will try to use Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM and Random Forest algorithms and compare the accuracy of these algorithms. As a result of this comparison, we aim to obtain a result close to the most accurate models obtained with artificial neural networks in the past. If we cannot obtain a model with sufficient success from these algorithms, we hope that what we will study in the 12th week will be our alternative solution in reaching our goal. After deciding on the most successful model, we will try to identify people with heart disease with this model.<br>\n",

    "The data has been studied in this manner already at kaggle. Although I like the data, and the questions you are asking, I know that this data and these questions were studied before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Either change the dataset and find a dataset that hasn't been studied as much, or find some other questions and methods that are more interesting, deeper and require a little more work to answer than these.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case (you decide to use this dataset, or use some other dataset) I would like to see a sample together with explanations on each piece. Moreover, you need to clearly state your hypotheses and questions. (This part is already been done.) Then you need to explain which machine learning algorithms you are going to use and explain how they are going to help you to answer the questions you are asking. How are you going to know/text if the results of the algorithms applied on the dataset confirm or contradict with your hypotheses?\n",

    "Finally, I am gointo need clear statements in the calendar on which team member is doing what and when.\n"

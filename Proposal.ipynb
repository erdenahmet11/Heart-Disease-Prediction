    "## Description of the Problem\n",
    "Thanks to advancing technology, the use of machine learning in the healthcare industry is becoming increasingly popular to assist doctors in making diagnoses.Machine learning plays an important role in diagnosing diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart diseases. Heart diseases are the leading cause of death in the world, we will examine people at risk by determining which symptoms in people are more related to heart disease. Then, with machine learning algorithms, we will try to predict whether the person has a heart disease depending on the symptoms in the dataset. According to our research, many machine learning algorithms have been tried from past to present in the diagnosis of heart disease and artificial neural networks give the most accurate results. In this project, we will analyze the data in the best way and compare which algorithm gives the most accurate model by using the machine learning algorithms we have learned in this lecture. Since this is a binary classification problem, we will try to use Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM and Random Forest algorithms and compare the accuracy of these algorithms. As a result of this comparison, we aim to obtain a result close to the most accurate models obtained with artificial neural networks in the past. If we cannot obtain a model with sufficient success from these algorithms, we hope that what we will study in the 12th week will be our alternative solution in reaching our goal. After deciding on the most successful model, we will try to identify people with heart disease with this model.<br>\n",

    "   This is not a proposal. It looks like a first draft written in 10 minutes. Unacceptable!!,\n",
    "    The questions you are asking are too simple (The code can be written less than 10 minutes from scratch, might be longer if cut/pasted from internet). Come up with better questions and hypotheses. With that also think of available ML algorithms to test your questions and hypotheses. Which algorithms are suitable? Which ones are you going to choose? Why? How are they going to solve/answer your questions? What do you expect? Which tests are you going to use? WHat happens if your experiments fail? Do you have alternative hypotheses and questions?,\n",
